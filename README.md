# Spirit Detector

NOTE: This code is still under construction.

A fun web app that uses the webcam and motion sensing via Javascript. A bell will ring if there is motion above a certain threshold.

## Start

`npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.
